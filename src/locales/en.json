Our interest in human health started when we observed that not everyone is aware of how a simple thing as food could change their lives. People spend a lot in treatment of diet-related diseases which could be avoided by eating healthy foods. In addition, there is more that could be done in the field of nutrition and we felt that it is time we did something about that.",

The human body requires all sorts of nutrients and with careful planning, you can afford a healthy diet everyday and stop worrying about getting sick.",
    "p3": "Using a smart algorithm, we can create for you a meal that contains all the nutrients required by the body within a matter of seconds. At whatever time you choose your meal, you can have it in a nearest eatery or simply decide to prepare at the comfort of your home. You can edit the servings, select the eatery of your choice and reserve a seat for that time. We have simplified the process of planning meals to a fast and more robust activity.",
