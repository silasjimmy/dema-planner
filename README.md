# Dema planner

## Description
Dema planner is a meal planning app that utilizes locally available foods to create balanced diets. There are a lot of meal planning and food tracking apps that exists today. After intensive research, we realized that they all have one drawback in common; they do not consider the food's availability in the user's region. Thus this formed the motivation behind the development of this application.

Since to implement the system required the basic functionalities like meal planning to work, we decided to build the system from the ground up. However, our goal is not to re-invent another system but to show how the option of food availability can be added to the planning system. In addition to this, also add more functionalities to help the users plan their meals with ease.

## Technology
```vuejs``` and ```vuetify``` for the frontend
```firebase``` for the backend
```vuex``` for state management
